# Predictive-Uncertainty-Estimation-Using-Deep-Ensemble
This repository is for implementation of the paper Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles. This algorithm quantifies predictive predictive uncertainty in non-Bayesian NN with Deep Ensemble Model.  Contribution of this paper is that it describes simple and scalable method for estimating predictive uncertainty estimates from NN.
